Notes

in train_neural_net, set_neural_net_input only needs to happen during the initial step not at every iteration


//Easiest way to implement a conv net

sum the images for each number
this results in 10 "reference" images

Convolve each reference image with the input image

take the max over 2x2 pixel sections

feed the maxes into the neural network as the inputs

only do this for the first stage.  This will not change back propagation at all



if all you do is take the max correlation over the entire image and compare that with the max corr obtained from convolving it with the other 9 reference images one can achieve 78% predictive accuracy (which isn't bad)  

Zero padding is optional but some is recommeded
